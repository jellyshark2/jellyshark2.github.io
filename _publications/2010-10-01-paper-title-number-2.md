* I am the first author of this paper.
* In this paper, we propose a noval method to implement an attack-agnostic and model-agnostic defense against poisoning attacks in recommender systems. For each user, we leverage its neighbors to adjust the network, unlearning the malicious influence and finally make a robust prediction. We also conduct a theoretical bound about the unlearning strength.
* In this project, I did all experiment, conducted the theoretical proof and wrote the paper.
