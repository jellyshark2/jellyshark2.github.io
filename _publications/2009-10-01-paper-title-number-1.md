title: "Robust Federated Learning Mitigates Client-side Training Data Distribution Inference Attacks"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2009-10-01-paper-title-number-1
excerpt: 'I am the first author to write this paper. Having found that existing defenses are weak in client-side reconstruction attacks in federated learning, this paper proposes an aggregation rule to mitigate such attacks. What's more, it proposes an adaptive attack that can slightly subvert the defense. This paper is submitted on NDSS 2024.'
