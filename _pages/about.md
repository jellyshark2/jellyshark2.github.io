I am a fourth year undergraduate student in Computer Science at USTC. My current research interests include various areas about trustworthy machine learning, like secure federated learning systems, secure recommender, etc. I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. Neil Zhenqiang Gong as the summer intern and Prof. Defu Lian during past years.
