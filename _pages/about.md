I am a fourth year undergraduate student in School of the Gifted Young at University of Science and Technology of China (USTC). My current research interests include various areas about trustworthy machine learning, like secure federated learning systems, secure recommender, etc. I am looking for a Ph.D. position.

Education
======
* School of the Gifted Young, University of Science and Technology of China
* GPA:3.91(major), 3.77(cumulative)
* **Computer Science Coursework:**  Introduction to Computer Systems(98), Operating System(H)(96), Computer Programming A(92), C Language Programming II(95), Data Structure(90), Computer Networks(91), Network System Experiment(93), Introduction to Information Security(96).
* **Mathematics Coursework:**  Functions of Complex VariableB(91), Equations of Mathematical Physics(91), Fundations of Mathematical Logic(95), Introduction to Formal Method(96), Mathematical Analysis B1(97), Mathematical Analysis B2(90), Linear Algebra B1(95),  Stochastic Processes B(95).

Research Experiences
======
* **Poisoning Federated Recommendation Using Fake Users**(July, 2023 to October, 2023(expected))  
Advisor: Neil Zhenqiang Gong(Duke)
  * Use fake users with absolutely no extra knowledge to attack the federated recommender system.
  * Shown to be effective on robust aggregation rules even when the proportion of fake users is extremely low
  * Plan to submit on UseNix

* **Apply Real-time Vicinal Defense make the Robust Recommendation**(December, 2021 to August, 2023)  
Advisor: Professor Defu Lian(USTC)
  * Adjust the model in inference phase to unlearn the malicious influence
  * Conducted a theoretical bound about its unlearning ability
  * Apply our method to further improve other robust defenses
  * Submitted to AAAI as the first author

* **Robust Federated Learning Mitigates Client-side Data Reconstruction Attacks**(Feburary, 2023 to June, 2023)  
Advisor: Neil Zhenqiang Gong(Duke)
  * Test that existing aggregation rules are vulnerable in mitigating client-side data reconstruction attacks
  * Propose an aggregation rule to mitigate client-side data reconstruction attacks
  * Propose an adaptive attack that can slightly subvert our defense, but our defense still appears to be robust
  * Submitted to NDSS as the first author
  
Awards & Honors
======
* Talent Student Prize(gold, 2022)
* Hua Xia Talent Program First Prize Scholarship(2022)
* Hua Xia Talent Program First Prize Scholarship(2020)
* Talent Student Price(silver,2021)
* ACM ICPC regional prize,bronze medal
