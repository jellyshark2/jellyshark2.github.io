I am a fourth year undergraduate student in School of the Gifted Young at University of Science and Technology of China (USTC). My current research interests include various areas about trustworthy machine learning, like secure federated learning systems, secure recommender, etc. I am looking for a Ph.D. position.

## Education
* GPA:3.91(major), 3.77(cumulative)
* Computer Science Coursework:  Introduction to Computer Systems(98), Operating System(H)(96), Computer Programming A(92), C Language Programming II(95), Data Structure(90), Computer Networks(91), Network System Experiment(93), Introduction to Information Security(96).
* Mathematics Coursework:  Functions of Complex VariableB(91), Equations of Mathematical Physics(91), Fundations of Mathematical Logic(95), Introduction to Formal Method(96), Mathematical Analysis B1(97), Mathematical Analysis B2(90), Linear Algebra B1(95),  Stochastic Processes B(95).

## Research Experiences
* <span style="color: #007bff;"><b>Poisoning Federated Recommendation Using Fake Users</b></span>  
  * Advised by Prof. Neil Zhenqiang Gong in Duke University, planning to submit to UseNix on Oct. 2023.
  * Use fake users with absolutely no extra knowledge to attack the federated recommender system.
  * Shown to be effective on robust aggregation rules even when the proportion of fake users is extremely low

* <span style="color: #007bff;"><b>Apply Real-time Vicinal Defense make the Robust Recommendation</b></span>  
  * I am the first author, advised by Prof. Defu Lian, submitted to AAAI on Aug. 2023.
  * Adjust the model in inference phase to unlearn the malicious influence
  * Conducted a theoretical bound about its unlearning ability
  * Apply our method to further improve other robust defenses

* <span style="color: #007bff;"><b>Robust Federated Learning Mitigates Client-side Data Reconstruction Attacks</b></span>  
  * I am the first author, advised by Prof. Neil Zhenqiang Gong, submitted to NDSS on July 2023.
  * Test that existing aggregation rules are vulnerable in mitigating client-side data reconstruction attacks
  * Propose an aggregation rule to mitigate client-side data reconstruction attacks
  * Propose an adaptive attack that can slightly subvert our defense, but our defense still appears to be robust
  
## Awards & Honors
* Talent Student Prize(gold, 2022)
* Hua Xia Talent Program First Prize Scholarship(2022)
* Hua Xia Talent Program First Prize Scholarship(2020)
* Talent Student Price(silver,2021)
* ACM ICPC regional prize,bronze medal
* Mathematics Competition in Anhui(2021), second prize

## Skills
* Adept in Assembly Language,C/C++,Python,Rust,Verilog,Java,C#
* Deep understanding of machine learning and deep learning
* Have command of machine learning toolkits, like tensorflow, pytorch
* Have a good command of basical math, i.e. mathematical analysis,matrix analysis
