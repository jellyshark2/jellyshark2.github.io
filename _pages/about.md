## Research Experiences
<span style="color: #007bff;"><b>Apply Real-time Vicinal Defense make the Robust Recommendation</b></span>  
Advisor: Prof. [Defu Lian](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~liandefu/) (USTC)
* Found that most defenses are specified to a certain type of models or attacks, which lacks the generality.
* Observed that malicious data resides in blind spots of the latent space, but if concentrate on a single user, its neighbors are likely to be benign. Proposed a method that adjusts the model in inference phase to unlearn the malicious influence. Conducted a theoretical bound about its unlearning ability.
* Shown to be quite effective on many state-of-the-art attacks as well as on many recommender systems. Applied our method on other robust defenses and saw further improvements.

<span style="color: #007bff;"><b>Poisoning Federated Recommendation Using Fake Users</b></span>  
Advisor: Prof. [Neil Zhenqiang Gong](https://people.duke.edu/~zg70/) (Duke University)
* Found that current poisoning attacks on federated recommender system either need additional information like the interaction matrix or local training data, which is not practical.
* Proposed a method that uses fake users with absolutely no extra knowledge and no local training data. This method directly constructs a target model to perform the attack.
* Examined to be effective on robust aggregation rules even when the proportion of fake users is extremely low, largely surpassed baselines.

<span style="color: #007bff;"><b>Robust Federated Learning Mitigates Client-side Data Reconstruction Attacks</b></span>  
Advisor: Prof. [Neil Zhenqiang Gong](https://people.duke.edu/~zg70/) (Duke University)
* Tested that existing aggregation rules are vulnerable in mitigating client-side data reconstruction attacks.
* Proposed an aggregation rule to mitigate client-side data reconstruction attacks. Also proposed an adaptive attack that can slightly subvert our defense, but our defense still appears to be robust.
* Compared our method on 10 baselines and 5 datasets. It significantly surpassed those baselines across many evaluation metrics. The method was also shown to be effective in membership inference attacks.

<span style="color: #007bff;"><b>Coreset: Theoretically Guaranteed Perspective to Accelerate TRADES</b></span> (ongoing)  
Advisor: Prof. [Hu Ding](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~huding/) (USTC)
* Employ a two-stage stratified sampling approach to construct a coreset and hence enhance the efficiency of the TRADES algorithm.
* Give theoretical guarantee to the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.
