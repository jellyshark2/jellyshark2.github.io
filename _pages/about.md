## Research Experiences
<span style="color: #007bff;"><b>Poisoning Federated Recommendation Using Fake Users</b></span>  
Advisor: Prof. [Neil Zhenqiang Gong](https://people.duke.edu/~zg70/)
* Found that current poisoning attacks on federated recommender system either need additional information like the interaction matrix or local training data, which is not practical.
* Proposed a method that uses fake users with absolutely no extra knowledge and no local training data. This method directly constructs a target model to perform the attack.
* Examined to be effective on robust aggregation rules even when the proportion of fake users is extremely low, largely surpassed baselines.

<span style="color: #007bff;"><b>Apply Real-time Vicinal Defense make the Robust Recommendation</b></span>  
* I am the first author. I have conducted all the experiments, derived mathematical proofs, and written the entire paper.
* Advised by Prof. Defu Lian in USTC, submitted to AAAI on Aug. 2023.
* Contribution: &nbsp;(1) Adjust the model in inference phase to unlearn the malicious influence. &nbsp;(2) Conducted a theoretical bound about its unlearning ability. &nbsp;(3) Apply our method to further improve other robust defenses

<span style="color: #007bff;"><b>Robust Federated Learning Mitigates Client-side Data Reconstruction Attacks</b></span>  
* I am the first author. I have proposed the adaptive attack using PGD, conducted all experiments, and written the entire paper.
* Advised by Prof. Neil Zhenqiang Gong in Duke University, submitted to NDSS on July 2023.
* Contribution: &nbsp;(1) Test that existing aggregation rules are vulnerable in mitigating client-side data reconstruction attacks. &nbsp;(2) Propose an aggregation rule to mitigate client-side data reconstruction attacks. &nbsp;(3) Propose an adaptive attack that can slightly subvert our defense, but our defense still appears to be robust
