My interest in computer science and mathematics can be traced back to my early childhood. During high school, I won awards in mathematics and computer programming competitions. At the age of 16, I attended the School of the Gifted Young at the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC). During my undergraduate studies, I realized the importance of mathematics in computer research. I excelled in all my math courses and self-studied advanced mathematical theories such as matrix analysis and convex optimization.

In my first year of college, I participated in a research project on cloud computing and machine learning systems at Imperial College London. This was my first experience with scientific research, where I explored parallelization efficiency of decision trees and learned about the application of distributed computing in machine learning. I also gained knowledge about writing academic papers, and my performance received high recognition from Professor Peter Piezutch.

In my second year of college, I joined the laboratory of Professor Lian Defu at USTC, where I independently worked on a research project on defense against poisoning attacks. It was my first significant research endeavor, and I encountered various difficulties. For instance, there was a challenge in simultaneously achieving batch computation and storage savings during the inference phase. I struggled with this problem until I tried breaking down the summation terms and using matrix multiplication instead, simplifying the prediction equation and improving algorithm efficiency while saving storage space. Another impressive challenge was in the theoretical part of the paper, which required strict derivation of the adaptability of the trained model on a new dataset after removing some data points. It was a challenging problem to tackle, and I guessed it involved gradient unlearning theory. Through extensive reading of relevant literature and exploration of mathematical theorems, I completed the mathematical proof for the paper. In August 2023, I submitted this paper as the first author to the AAAI conference. The difficulty I overcame in completing this paper enhanced my confidence in pursuing future research.

In February 2023, I collaborated with Professor Neil Gong from Duke University to research effective inference attacks for data reconstruction under byzantine robust aggregation rules. The research initially faced challenges as the mathematical restrictions of Median limited the attack effectiveness when data was not non-iid. However, I discovered that when the number of clients distributing the training data of each label reached a certain threshold, Median suddenly became ineffective. I started contemplating the reasons behind this phenomenon and shifted my work towards defending against this attack. I proposed a new aggregation rule that outperformed other defenses when the proportion of attackers was high or when data was iid while maintaining model accuracy. After designing this method, I conducted extensive experiments, wrote the paper, and submitted it as the first author to NDSS in June 2023.

Following that, under the guidance of Professor Neil Gong, I undertook another research project on achieving efficient poisoning attacks in federated recommendation systems with an extremely low proportion of fake users, no local training data, and no information about the rating matrix. I reproduced a federated recommendation framework and proposed my unique methodology based on estimating popular items to assist the attack through observing item embeddings sent to the attacker. This method significantly improved upon existing baselines and could still perform successful attacks even under Byzentine-robust aggregation rules. We plan to submit this paper to UseNix in Oct. on 2023.

Due to time constraints during my undergraduate studies, my research primarily focused on trusted machine learning. However, my passion for learning extends beyond this specific field. Through school courses, online course enrolments, reading academic papers, and other means, I am actively seeking knowledge and methodologies in other areas of artificial intelligence such as natural language processing and computer vision. I believe exploring multiple directions will enhance my insights and contribute to the depth and breadth of my future scientific research.

In both my studies and personal life, I have always approached challenges with optimism and passion. While facing countless difficulties, I have never complained or stagnated. My future goal is to obtain a faculty position at a university, as I believe I can make significant contributions in the field of computer research.
